### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub that I started in 2018 (that was 5 years ago). I've wanted to learn to code for a long time, but when I get stuck, I find it easier to avoid it. 

I've encountered many of the roadblocks that many other people mention, and I really hope I can commit to one thing: learning JavaScript both in and out. I plan to tackle things differently this time, seek help, join community groups, and complete the projects I get started. 

- 👩‍💼 I'm currently an executive assistant
- 🔭 I am hoping I can learn enough to switch careers
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript
- 🏖 Fun fact: I love warm weather

Thanks for stopping by!
